# jqueryfilter
Simple JQuery Filter for filtering using multiple &lt;select> in HTML

The code uses three "select" controls of HTML and list items.

1. The web page includes 20 different listing of cars

2. Each listing contains an image of the car, year of the car (e.g. 2012), make of the car (e.g. Maruti), model of the car (e.g. WagonR) and selling price of the car

3. The page also includes a filter that includes Year, Make and Price

So basically if I apply filter with Year 2012 and Make Maruti, the listings of Maruti cars that are 2012 Year are shown without reloading the webpage.
